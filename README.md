# Perfmon InfluxDB Exporter

NodeJS application using Cisco Perfmon API to export data to InfluxDB. There are 3 ways this application will collect data from CUCM to export to InfluxDB.

1. Collect objects for a specific server(s) based on a configuration file provided to application. File example is provided in the repo in the **data** folder. To use you must rename to **config.json** and make sure your volume is mapped correctly in the docker-compose.yml file. If no config.json file is present the application will move on to the next method. See below for more information.
2. Collect all objects for a specific server(s) in a single request. This is done via the enviromental variable PM_OBJECT_COLLECT_ALL. This method has the greatest risk of being rate limited by CUCM API. To limit the risk of being rate limited, you can increase the PM_OBJECT_COLLECT_ALL_CONCURRENCY enviromental variable to regulate the number of objects collected at once. Other methods would be to use the PM_SERVERS enviromental variable to limit the servers being polled, or separate the objects into multiple requests based on different PM_INVERVAL. For example you could collect some objects every 15 seconds and other objects every 60 seconds. If using this method, it's suggested to keep the number of objects to a minimum to reduce the risk of being rate limited.
3. Collect all objects for a specific server(s) in a session based request that return percentage values. This is done via the enviromental variable PM_OBJECT_SESSION_PERCENTAGE and PM_OBJECT_SESSION_PERCENTAGE_SLEEP. Note this also has the risk of being rate limited by CUCM API, however the risk is lower than the PM_OBJECT_COLLECT_ALL method. As of CUCM 15 there are only five (Memory,Processor,Process,Partition,Thread) objects that return percentage values. This method is suggested for these objects only.

Application will attempt to collect data in the order listed above. If any method is not present, it will move to the next method. If all methods are not present, the application will log an error and exit.

## Features

- Collects Perfmon data from CUCM and exports to InfluxDB
- Uses pm2 for process management and recovery. Can be used with pm2.io for monitoring externally.
- Docker container for easy deployment
- Configurable via enviromental variables
- Ability to generate config.json file for specific objects to collect
- Ability to collect all objects for a specific server(s) in a single request
- Ability to collect all objects for a specific server(s) in a session based request that return percentage values
- Ability to stagger the start of the containers via PM_DELAYED_START enviromental variable
- Ability to have multiple containers running with different objects to collect, saving to different buckets in InfluxDB.

## Installation

If you like to run the application locally, you can clone the repo and run the following commands:

```node
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:run
```

## Running via Docker

- Create folder directory. Example: 
```linux
mkdir /docker/perfmon
```
- cd to new folder
```
cd /docker/perfmon
```
- Create docker-compose.yml > touch docker-compose.yml. Example provided in repo.
```
touch docker-compose.yml
``` 
- Create .env from above > touch .env. Example provided in repo.
```
touch .env
```
- Run > docker compose up -d
```
docker compose up -d
```

#### Docker Compose file:

```docker
services:
  perfmon:
    image: sieteunoseis/perfmon-influx-exporter:latest
    command:
      - start
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./data:/usr/src/app/data
```

Note: Enviromental variables set the docker-compose.yml file will override the .env file. Useful if you have multiple containers running with different objects to collect, different InfuxDB buckets, or different servers to poll.

#### Generating config.json file

Docker container has the ability to generate a config.json file for you. This is useful if you are unsure of the objects you'd like to collect. Creating a config.json file and mapping the volume will decreases the amount of data being collected from CUCM, which can help with rate limiting. This is also useful if you are only collecting data for a specific set of servers.

Using Docker to generate the config.json file:

```linux
docker run -d -v $(pwd)/data:/usr/src/app/data --env-file=.env sieteunoseis/perfmon-influx-exporter:latest config hq-cucm-pub.abc.inc "Cisco AXL Tomcat Connector,Cisco AXL Tomcat JVM,Cisco AXL Tomcat Web Application,Cisco AXL Web Service,Cisco CallManager,Cisco CallManager System Performance"
```

This will generate a config.json file in the data folder. You can then modify the file to include the objects you'd like to collect.

## PERFMON OBJECTS

Current list of Perfmon objects as of CUCM 15.0. Suggest removing any objects for features that you are not using. This will help with rate limiting. Check the logs for any object that returns 0 results

Note: Processor object is a percentage only object. It is suggested to use the PM_OBJECT_SESSION_PERCENTAGE enviromental variable to collect this object. You can also use the built in config generator to create a config.json file with the objects you'd like to collect.

## Troubleshooting

##### Verifing data via CUCM CLI:

```linux
show perf query counter "Cisco CallManager" "CallsActive"
```

##### Rate Limiting

If you are seeing errors in the logs:

```linux
{
  "status": 500,
  "code": "Internal Server Error",
  "host": "hq-cucm-pub.abc.inc",
  "object": "SAML SSO",
  "message": "Exceeded allowed rate for Perfmon information. Current allowed rate for perfmon information is 80 requests per minute.PerfmonService"
}
```

Suggest increasing the limit to 18 under the CUCM Enterprise Parameters for Rate Control → Allowed Device Queries Per Minute web interface.

##### Number of Nodes in the Cluster

In large cluster, configure your application to point SOAP clients to individual servers that have server specific Perfmon counters. This can be done via the **PM_SERVERS** enviromental variable.
  
##### Debugging CUCM Log files

To view the log files on the CUCM server:

```linux

file list activelog /tomcat/logs/soap/csv/ratecontrol*.csv page detail date reverse
file view activelog /tomcat/logs/soap/csv/ratecontrol*.csv

file list activelog /tomcat/logs/soap/csv/axis2ratecontrol*.csv page detail date reverse
file view activelog /tomcat/logs/soap/csv/axis2ratecontrol*.csv

file list activelog /tomcat/logs/soap/log4j/soap*.log page detail date reverse
file view activelog /tomcat/logs/soap/log4j/soap*.log
```

If you get a certificate error(s) you can try adding the following to your .env file:

```node
NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
```
